        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A type of sweet pastry that holds a portion of fruit surrounded by puffy dough.
            Made with a cream cheese dough that bakes buttery and flaky, the Kolaczki is often folded in a diamond shape.
            Popular fillings include apricot, raspberry, almond, and sweet cheese.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces cream cheese (room temp)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups salted butter (room temp)</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar (for rolling out dough)</li>
            <li>Confectioners' sugar (for rollong out dough)</li>
            <li>8-10 ounces pastry filling (raspberry, apricot, etc.)</li>
            <li>1 large egg white</li>
            <li>1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat cream cheese with butter until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, 1 cup at a time, and mix well.</li>
            <li>Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Heat oven to 350 F. Roll out dough to a 12 x 18-inch rectangle—1/4-inch thick—on
                 a silicone mat or a surface that has been dusted with equal parts confectioners' and 
                 granulated sugars (not flour), because the granulated sugar will act as ball bearings 
                 and help keep the dough from sticking.
            </li>
            <li>Cut into 2-inch squares. Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon filling on center of each square. 
                Brush a tiny bit of beaten egg white on one corner and press the opposite corner on it, 
                pressing the dough together lightly to seal.

            </li>
            <li>Using a spatula, transfer the filled cookies to a parchment-lined sheet pan and bake for 15 minutes 
                or until corners start to brown.

            </li>
            <li>Using a spatula, remove cookies from the baking sheet and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely 
                before dusting with confectioners’ sugar.
            </li>
        </ol>
